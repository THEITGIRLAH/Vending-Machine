Vending-Machine

This PHP project implements a vending machine change calculator. It simulates a simple vending machine that dispenses change for a purchased item when a single dollar bill is used for payment. The program ensures user input validation for item cost and payment amount and calculates the exact change in terms of quarters, dimes, and nickels.
